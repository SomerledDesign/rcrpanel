.TH rcrpanel 1 "27 Apr 2018"
.SH NAME
rcrpanel \- Create a PostScript file of a rcrpanel from a script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rcrpanel
.I filename
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B rcrpanel
reads a script file describing a panel and produces a PostScript image of that
panel on the standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
none
.SH INPUT FILE
The input file contains lines describing the various controls.  Most lines are of
the form
.I Command = something
where the spaces around the equal sign are significant, and the command itself
is case-sensitive.
.LP
Measurements are in units of millimeters.  Angles are in degrees.  Colors
are given as 24 bit C style integers where each byte repesents the amount of
red, green, or blue.
.SS Commands
.TP
\fBReverse\fR - 
This command takes no arguments.  If this command appears anywhere
in the input file, the resulting PostScript will be flipped left to right (for
printing on the reverse side of transparency material).

.TP
\fBControlLarge\fR - 
This is used for large diameter controls such as large pots
and the like.  It takes 2 values after the equal sign representing the position
of the control on the panel.

.TP
\fBControlPhone\fR - 
This is used for 1/4" phone jacks and similar controls.  The
2 values after the equal sign represent the position on the panel.

.TP
\fBControlLED\fR - 
This command generates an outline for a 5 mm LED.  Like the other
control commands, it takes 2 values, the X and Y positions on the panel of the
center of the LED.

.TP
\fBControlSmall\fR -
This command generates an outline for a 3.5 mm phone jack.  The two values are
the X and Y positions of the jack on the panel.

.TP
\fBControlTiny\fR -
This command generates an outline for a 2.5 mm phone jack.  The two values are
the X and Y positions of the jack on the panel.

.TP
\fBRectangle\fR -
This command defines the size of a rectangle and is used for cutouts such as LCDs
and connectors or switches.  The first two values define the X0 and Y0 coordinates
of the bottom left corner of the rectangle.  The next 2 dimensions are the width
and height of the rectangle.

.TP
\fBCenterRectangle\fR -
This command is the duplicate of 
.I Rectangle
with the change that the coordinates given are the center of the rectangle, not
the lower left corner.  The first two values define center coordinates of the 
rectangle.  The next 2 dimensions are the width and height of the rectangle.
This is useful for placing a rectangle where the center is known.

.TP
\fBPanel\fR -
This command defines the size of the panel.  The 2 dimensions are the width and
height of the panel.

.TP
\fBBackground\fR -
This command takes a single color following the equal sign.  The entire panel
will be filled with this color.

.TP
\fBText\fR -
This command is somewhat different from the others.  After the equal sign, 
it takes 3 floating point numbers, a color, and a text string.  The fist 2 floating point
numbers are the X, Y position of the text on the panel.  The third number is the
height of the text.  The color represents the color of the text, and the text string
represents the font to be used.  No checking is done before preparing the PostScript;  you
are responsible for ensuring that the font is available on your printer.

This command is then followed by another line containing the text to be displayed.

.TP
\fBDial\fR -
This command introduces a new dial.  The 
.B Dial 
command describes the X,Y center
of the dial.  The following commands then further refine the details of this
particular dial.  This relationship between the
.B Dial
command and it's successors is the only place where the order of the commands
within the file matters.

.TP
\fBRadius\fR -
This command takes a single value which is the radius of the circle which
forms the inside of the tick marks.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.

.TP
\fBSpan\fR -
This command describes the angle over which the control may operate.  Typically,
this would be 270 for a potentiometer and 180 for a variable capacitor.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBNumTicks\fR -
This command describes the total number of tick marks, large and small,
to be drawn.  This is usually an odd number since the starting and ending
values are counted.  Typically this will be 11, 101, or a similar number.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBBigPer\fR -
This command tells the program how many small tick marks there are per
large tick mark.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBSizeTicks\fR -
This command describes the length of the small tick marks.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBSizeBig\fR -
This command describes the length of the large tick marks.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBStartingIndicator\fR -
This command describes the value to be placed on the furthest
counterclockwise large tick mark.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBIncrementPerBigTick\fR -
This command tells rcrpanel how much to increment the value in 
.B StartingIndicator
for each succeding large tick mark.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBSizeFont\fR -
This command describes how large to make the annotation on the ticks.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBColorCircle\fR -
This command takes a single color as an argument, which is used to draw
the inner circle.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBColorTickMarks\fR -
This command permits setting the color to draw the small tick marks.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBColorBigTickMarks\fR -
This command permits setting the color to draw the large tick marks.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBColorText\fR -
This command accepts a single color which will be used for the annotation.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.


.TP
\fBStartAngle\fR -
By default,
.B rcrpanel
arranges dials so the dead spot on the control is straight down.  This is the desired
behavior in almost all cases.  However, sometimes you may want to rotate a control to
some other orientation.  The single argument to
.B StartAngle
is the number of degrees clockwise to rotate the control.
This command refers to the current 
.B Dial 
command.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Current compiled in limits are 20 dials, 50 controls and 50 text strings.
Strings are limited to 127 characters and font names may be no more than
31 characters long.

.SH BUGS
None known
.PP
.B rcrpanel 
is still lacking the ability to draw random straight lines but it does rectangles now.
