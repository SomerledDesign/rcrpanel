rcrpanel

Hokay guys, this one is ugly enough that it needs some dox.

The program reads a text script file and outputs PostScript to stdout.
The lines in the script file are (mostly) of the form:

keyword space equals space stuff

It's pretty picky about stuff like spelling and case and all that.
Most of the Dial keywords work, but there are a bunch of others.  The
following are the 'normal' keywords:

ControlLarge = <x> <y>    For 1/4" shaft pots etc.
ControlPhone = <x> <y>    for 1/4" phone jacks
ControlLED = <x> <y>      for 5mm LED holders
ControlSmall = <x> <y>    for 3.5mm phone jacks
ControlTiny = <x> <y>     for 2.5mm phone jacks
ControlMicro = <x> <y>    for 3 mm LED holes
Rectangle = <x> <y> <width> <height> for cutouts
CenterRectangle = <x> <y> <width> <height> for cutouts
Panel = <x> <y>           describes the size of the panel
Background = <hexcolor>   sets the background color for the panel

A few specials:

Reverse                   no arguments, reverses the result.  This
                          is useful for printing on film so that the
                          actual printing is protected.  This is NOT
                          a toggle, 1 thru n appearances of Reverse
                          cause the entire result to be reversed.

Text = <x> <y> <s> <hexcolor> <f>    This one is unique because it
                          is followed by a line of text which will
                          be displayed at the specified location,
                          size and font.  (Your PostScript device
                          must recognize the font.)  Another little
                          quirk, the y dimension references the bottom
                          of the text, but the x dimension, the center.
                          I thought this better for centering the
                          annotation over controls.

Dial = <x> <y>            This is a little unique because it must
                          precede any dial parameters.  Each time
                          a Dial appears, successive dial params
                          apply to the new dial.

Dial keywords are the same as the Dial program: Radius, Span,
StartAngle, NumTicks, BigPer, SizeTicks, SizeBig, StartingIndicator,
IncrementPerBigTick, SizeFont, ColorCircle, ColorTickMarks,
ColorBigTickMarks, ColorText.  These parameters are errors unless
there was at least one Dial command earlier in the script.

If you add a Dial command with no parameters, the following defaults
are used:

    Radius              10 mm
    Span                270 degrees
    StartAngle          0 degrees
    NumTicks            81
    BigPer              10
    SizeTicks           1 mm
    SizeBig             4 mm
    ColorCircle         Black
    ColorTickMarks      Black
    ColorBigTickMarks   Black
    ColorText           Black
    SizeFont            1.5 mm
    StartingIndicator   14.0
    IncrementPerBigTick 0.01;

All measurements are in millimeters.  Measurements are from the lower
left corner of the panel (except obviously font heights and radii.)

rcrpanel.txt is an example but doesn't use all the commands.

Compiled in limits ... if you compile this for DOS or some other
memory-deficient OS, you may want to reduce some of these.  I can't
imagine a panel with more of these (well, maybe controls if you REALLY
like LEDs):

  Dials          20
  Controls       50
  Text strings   50
  Rectangles     50
